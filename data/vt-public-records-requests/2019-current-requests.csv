Subject: Request for Contact Information

Dear Melissa:

Hello and I hope the email finds you well!  My name is Dr. Cathy Marcum and I am an associate professor of Justice Studies at Appalachian State University in Boone, NC.  My colleague, Dr. George Higgins of the University of Louisville, and I are currently doing research on the management of nonconsensual pornography cases by courts in the United States.  Dr. Higgins and I have an extensive history of publications in the cybercrime and victimization fields, as well as law enforcement response to these crimes (I am happy to send you a CV if you would like to see further information).  Our current project involves surveying district attorneys and chief prosecuting attorneys from every state to investigate their experiences with these cases, management, and outcomes.

Does your agency have an electronic or paper document available that has the contact information for these individuals for the state of Vermont?  If so, could we have access to this document?

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the study or need any other information.  Thank you in advance for your help!

Sincerely,
Cathy Marcum",Email Request,Closed,Fulfilled in part,Not the Custodian,,04/15/2019 12:00:00 AM

John Olson recalls that Shell provided you with a document related to “best practices” which – I gather – takes a deeper dive into some of what he presented in his PowerPoint.

Hello,

I believe my great-grandparents once owned land in one of the Rutlands, possibly in the Nineteen teens and nineteen twenties. Their name was  M. Farbstein. Would you be able to tell me if a record of such a property ownership exists, if so, where it was, or where I could search for such a record?

Thank you very much for any assistance.

30240,PSD,02/06/2019 12:00:00 AM,Stephen Whitaker,"I'm guessing that the 2005 order applies only to Consolidated as the dominant ILEC  here in Vermont. Don't VTel, Waitsfield/Champlain, TDS, Otelco, Level3/CenturyLink, Franklin, etc. lease dark fiber to competitors upon request?

This prompts me to inquire of you for copies of records transferred from the VTA to the Department, specifically the VTA's agreement/contract with Sovernet when funding/building the fiber rings with ARRA/BTOP funding.

As I understand it, there was a provision in the Sovernet agreement or the enabling legislation which allowed Sovernet to not be required to unbundle dark fiber for lease to competitors when it was determined that such leasing would ""undermine its business case.""

Do you have documentation of any challenges to SoverNet invoking that provision or subsequent calculations of the ""business case"" test completed or revisited since Oak Hill Capital Partners acquired SoverNet and FirstLight or the recent Antin Infrastructure Partners acquisition of both?

Are there any documents in the Department's files detailing recommended CPG transfer conditions or other possible stipulated conditions that could or should be requested/demanded  as part of the PUC's approval of  either of the acquisitions? What public benefit does that State retain in consideration of the $33M+ investment in SoverNer fiber?

I believe many of the fiber service drops SoverNet  installed for the Community Anchor Institutions include six or eight fiber strands. Does the State/VTA retain the right to access or utilize those additional fibers at non-discriminatory rates were a competing fiber carrier such a CVFiber to offer service to the Kellogg Hubbard Library or the Twin Valley High School? Any pertinent documents are requested and would be appreciated.

Might these open access to dark fiber issues be addressed in the next Draft of the Telecom Plan? A dark fiber rulemaking or rate case?

I also learned today that the PUC staff is not aware of any records in their possession that detail which ILEC remotes are still not protected by diverse routes connecting them to their host switches. This is urgently important in light of the isolations issue and the pending NG911 RFP and proposed contract. Do you have any of the information that I requested from the PUC? If so, I request a copy.",Email Request,Closed,Fulfilled in part,Statutory Exemption,"1V.S.A § 317(c)(1) confidential by law,1V.S.A § 317(c)(2) limited disclosure,1V.S.A § 317(c)(9) trade secrets",02/21/2019 12:00:00 AM

Subject: PRR for VTel/FirstLight communications

Hi Kristy, 

I'm writing to request the following:

- All communications between Agency of Digital Services, VTel and FirstLight since July 1, 2019. 

I am particularly interested in communications that relate to FirstLight's use of Huawei gear and it's reaction to a recent story published in VTDigger headlined: ""Banned Huawei gear used by Vermont E911 network contractor."" 

But given the relatively short timeframe, I am requesting all communication between ADS and these two company in the past week. Please let me know if you need any additional information. 

--------

Because this request is in the public interest, I request that you waive any fees for filling it. If fees are assessed, please notify me before proceeding. If, after that conversation, fees are charged, please provide a detailed receipt explaining the purpose of each fee charged. 

If some of this material will take longer to provide than other portions, please provide any segments of the requested information as soon as it is available. If this information is available in electronic format, please provide it in that manner. If any or all of the information can be provided by email, please do so. 

-C

Subject: VTDigger records request 6/27

Hi Melissa, 

Pursuant to Vermont’s Public Records Act, I am seeking the following information:

Any communications, including emails, written memos, instructions or letters sent by the Agency of Administration to Vermont state agencies and departments related to the ""strategic budgeting initiative,"" between April 1, 2019 and the date this request is fulfilled. 

Because this request is in the public interest, I request that you waive any fees for filling it. If fees are assessed, please notify me before proceeding. If, after that conversation, fees are charged, please provide a detailed receipt explaining the purpose of each fee charged.
 
If some of this material will take longer to provide than other portions, please provide any segments of the requested information as soon as it is available. If this information is available in electronic format, please provide it in that manner. If any or all of the information can be provided by email, please do so.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions about this request. I trust you will respond to my request for the records within the timeframe set out in the Public Records Act.
 
Should you deny access to any of the records I am requesting, please provide me with a list of those records, cite the specific exemption that applies to each record or portion of the record being withheld and provide a description of the material that has been withheld.
 
If a record has a portion that is exempt from disclosure, the law [1 VSA 318 (e)] requires that only the exempt portion be redacted, and that a copy of the rest of the document be released, together with a notation of the specific exemption that applies to the portion withheld. In that event, please also indicate the name and title of the person responsible for the denial and, as the law requires, please inform me of the appeal procedures available to me, and the name of the person to whom an appeal may be made.
 
Thank you for your assistance.

Best,

Subject: tell who to ask question

Hello, my name is Egor. I live in the Russian Federation in Yakutsk, on 02/14/2018 I purchased a TOYOTA HIGHLANDER VIN JTEEP21A250074561 car, engine number 3 MZ 0148305, the country of export of a US car, year of manufacture 2005.
According to the official website of the CARFA Vehicle Yistory Report, I found that the release date of this car was 10.06.2004, the car was sold by an official dealer on 12.23.2004 by the Vermont automobile department and was subsequently put up and sold at auction 01.29.2008. and sent to Russia.
In this regard, I had a question on the actual year of production of the car and therefore I would like to provide information about the year of production of the car, the name of the plant where the car was assembled, the name and address of the official dealer who sold the car, the mileage of the car (in miles), the date of its sale in Russia.
I ask to send the information to my email address Popovee@mail.ru, for any questions that arise, please contact me by phone: 79142718379.",Email Request,Closed,Fulfilled in part,Not the Custodian,,07/18/2019 12:00:00 AM

Actually, I'd be curious to know if the industry applies for permits of any sort.  But I am especially disturbed by incidents of the industry using wetlands as a place to pile rubble and get it out of their way.  Something over 75% of the rock they take out of a pit is just waste so they just move it to get it out of their way.  So, things like the following 2 pictures are done, I assume, without permits.  But if there are permits I will stand corrected.
The following picture is taken from the bottom of Hilltop road in Wells as it intersects with Bullfrog Hollow Road in Wells.  The quarry is run, I am quite sure, by one of the Camara brothers.",Email Request,Closed,Fulfilled in whole,,,04/05/2019 12:00:00 AM

Dear Commissioner Boedecker; 
We have reviewed the July 24 and July 25, 2019 postings to the ENB site.  Thank you.   
By email to the State dated April 3, 2019 (attached) the Permittee’s agent stated that “I believe this design change should alleviate many of the public questions, which were submitted …”
-	For your convenience I have attached the Public’s comments to this project.
The Permittee’s agent asked the State for guidance as to whether to respond to the public’s questions and/or speak to any of the public’s concerns.   
We have not located the Permittee’s response addressing the public’s concerns.   This leads us to question whether the State responded to the Permittee’s agent’s request for guidance in responding to the public’s concerns. 
Have either you or your staff instructed, recommended, suggested and/or otherwise directed the Permittee to respond to our concerns?  If yes, please provide details.
Additionally, 
For the period 2019 to present, please provide all documents and records that have not been posted to the ENB site including correspondence sent and received between the State and the Permittee, his agents and his representatives. 
The request for records is made pursuant to  1 V.S.A. § 317 .  
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Bob Butani",Email Request,Closed,Fulfilled in whole,,,07/30/2019 12:00:00 AM

30293,DEC,02/11/2019 12:00:00 AM,Craig Heindel,"Hi Jeff, Eric, Shawn and Bryn: I’m writing to confirm my understanding, based on my phone calls with Bryn Oakleaf [VTDEC Watershed Division, Permits & Compliance Supervisor] on Feb. 6, 2019 regarding the water withdrawal from two streams in southwest Shoreham by the Hescock Farm [also called Elysian Fields Dairy Farm]. Please confirm the following:
1.       Neither the Hescocks nor their environmental consultant Matt Montgomery [Vermont Compliance Monitoring] have been issued a water withdrawal permit to take water from streams or Lake Champlain on or off their property in Shoreham, Vermont.
2.       Neither the Hescocks nor their consultant have applied for a water withdrawal permit.
3.       Neither the Hescocks nor their consultant have contacted you or other VTDEC personnel who deal with water withdrawals from streams, requesting a “sign-off” or other information regarding the existing or proposed water withdrawals from streams in Shoreham, or from Lake Champlain adjacent to Shoreham.

Please send copies of any correspondence [electronic copies, sent via email would be fine] that you have had with the Hescocks or their consultants regarding water withdrawals from streams or Lake Champlain.

I left phone messages for both Jeff and Eric on Feb. 6, 2019 and have not received replies to this date.
If I don’t receive an email or phone reply to this email, I will assume that my points above are correct.

I copied Shawn Good [VT Fish & Wildlife] on this email because he is aware of the water withdrawals, and has corresponded or spoken with various DEC personnel, Mr. Hescock, Matt Montgomery and Dori Barton about this situation.

I also copied this email to Mike Adams, USACOE. I spoke with him on the phone on Feb. 5, 2019 about the Hescock Farm water withdrawals. He said he is aware of the Hescock Farm, and he has on his agenda in the next couple of weeks to take his first step, which is to determine whether there is federal jurisdiction over these water withdrawals.",Email Request,Closed,Not Fulfilled,Records Do Not Exist,,02/14/2019 12:00:00 AM

Thanks for coming up on Tuesday last and looking at the runoff / erosion issues here along the access road to the Fairlee Water Storage Tank area. 
If you could send a brief note outlining your findings that would be most helpful. 
Also, your thoughts re: what to do about the road materials that have come onto my property outside the ROW as a result of erosion/ runoff and snow plowing. 
Lastly, if you have access to SOV plans and can forward the plans for the 'redevelopment' of the right of way road here (permits from July/Aug 2018) I'd very much like to view. 
Many thanks again for making the time to come up and answer my questions.  
Kind regards,

I'd like to request all emails exchanged with Vincent (Vince) Illuzzi by any of these three people from July 1, 2018 to present:

Just to clarify, I'm looking for all emails exchanged with Mr. Illuzzi by any of those Division employees within that time frame.

My preferred method of receiving those public records is via email, to this address, but please let me know if that's not possible. Please also let me know if anything has been redacted from the records, what category of information that is and the reason for redaction.

And if you can let me know that you've received my request, it'd be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Public Records request

Good morning,

I hope this finds you well. My name is Mark Walker, a reporter in the Washington bureau of The New York Times.


Under the Vermont Public Records Law, §315 et seq., I am requesting an opportunity to inspect copies of public records:

I would like to request a copy of correspondence from outside parties with state officials as the state prepared in 2018 to submit a proposal to Treasury nominating census tracks that would be designated as Opportunity Zones. This would include all such correspondence from January 2018 through June 2019.

This request is only related to the following census tracts: 

50017959400
50027966700

This would not include correspondence only among state officials. Just emails received by these officials from outside parties related to these tracts as they were considered for possible inclusion in the Opportunity Zones plan and after designation. Please also include any other emails even if they do not have these tract numbers in them, but are part of the discussion.

Please provide copies of all emails received by or sent to outside parties by officials from the who were involved in the nomination process including state or county or other local officials and any private parties. 

I respectfully request that you waive all fees in connection with this request as provided by 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).  FOIA was designed to provide citizens a broad right to access government records. FOIA’s basic purpose is to “open agency action to the light of public scrutiny,” with a focus on the public’s “right to be informed about what their government is up to.” U.S. Dep’t of Justice v. Reporters Comm. For Freedom of Press, 489 U.S. 749, 773–74 (1989) (internal quotation and citations omitted). In order to provide public access to this information, FOIA’s fee waiver provision requires “[d]ocuments shall be furnished without any charge or at a [reduced] charge . . . disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).

The law requires a response to this request within 2 days, or within 10 days for extraordinary circumstances.  If you expect a significant delay in fulfilling this request, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.

If you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.


Thank you for considering my request.

Please call me if this request is not clear. I can be reached at 202 862 0414.

Dear Melissa,
 
I am researching the permit history for the Georgia Mountain Community Wind Project that’s located in Georgia and Milton, VT, and was hoping you could direct me to where I might confirm that no State Building Permit exists issued by the VT Dept of Public Safety.  Thank you so much in advance for your time!

Subject: [Website feedback] Public records request

Jessica Martin (jessica.martin@ticketnetwork.com) sent a message using the contact form at https://aoa.vermont.gov/contact.

Hello,

I am trying to find out where I need to submit the following public records request to:

Please provide me with any and all complaints related to entertainment, sporting events, ticketing companies or affiliated ticketed events which would include but not be limited to the following keywords: “tickets”, “event”, “concert”, “box office”, “theater”, for the time period of January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018.
   I request a waiver of all fees for this request since the disclosure of the information I seek is not primarily in my commercial interest, and is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, making the disclosure a matter of public interest. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than one business day, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.
If you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.


I look forward to your response!

Kind regards,

Jessica",Email Request,Closed,Fulfilled in part,Not the Custodian,,09/30/2019 12:00:00 AM

I’m hoping I’m contacting the right person, but please let me know to whom I should direct this request if not!  I am researching some older permits for the Georgia Mountain Community Wind project that’s located in Georgia and Milton. I have looked through files we inherited as well as on the ANR atlas, and searched all online databases that I could find.  The permits I am specifically looking for are listed below, but I am hoping to obtain all copies of anything to do with these permits, such as former version, amendments, and/or transfers.  I was also hoping you could explain the relevance of the various dates mentioned in the ANR atlas (which may be answered by viewing the permits themselves, but I wasn’t totally sure!).  The atlas lists issuance dates and expiration dates, but also a renewal date.  Does this mean the date by which a renewal application needs to be filed?

Subject: Request for LPG (Propane) storage details in Vermont

Dear Ms. Melissa Mazza-Paquette,

Greetings for the day.

I am Ranganathan Nagarajan from GlobalData.
 
I am looking for the list of LPG (propane) capacity and storage location in the state of Vermont. My requirement is 
 
•	LPG Propane Tank Size (preferably 6000 Gallon and above)
 
•	Address of the location
 
•	Whom the LPG propane tank is registered and business email if possible.
 
We have some specific storage and transport solution for LPG for which we would like to explore the opportunity. It would be great if you help me out with the above requested information.

Appreciate your help with this. 

Sincerely,
Ranganathan",Email Request,Closed,Fulfilled in part,Not the Custodian,,10/09/2019 12:00:00 AM

Subject: Lease Database

Hi there,

I was hoping to obtain some guidance on a public information request I am seeking to submit. I am seeking a dataset/list (excel or .cvs preferred) detailing all of the active leases the State has for real property (for various department offices for example) owned by private groups (not owned by the State). The data points of interest would be address, leased square feet, lease start date, lease expiration date, lease expense details, monthly or annual rent amount, landlord name, etc. If all these data points are not available that is okay. If there are additional data points that I have not listed that the State tracts for their leases, that would be desirable as well. 

Thank you so much and I hope to hear from you soon,",Email Request,Closed,Fulfilled in part,Not the Custodian,,10/31/2019 12:00:00 AM

Hi there
 
I am trying to find a background check on myself as I want to join a gun range in New Hampshire and they require I bring one when I get my membership.  Can you point me in the right direction?  I’m not sure if the links I found are records for court cases or convicts as they require a date!

Subject: Obtaining a birth record for 1790-1810

Good Morning,
I am in the process of Applying for the Mayflower Society and need a copy of my 2nd great Grandfather John Nelson's birth record. 

His parents are Artemissa Chamberlain born in  Thetford, VT (Apr 20, 1774) and Charles Campbell Nelson born in Woodstock, Windham, Connecticut (March 1768). John's parents were married in Thetford, March 4, 1790. 

I believe John was born around 1802 in Thetford or a neighboring town. I have contacted Thetford town clerk and they have not been able to locate his birth record. 

How would I go about requesting a search  for his birth record in the state of Vermont to cover the span of 1790 to 1810? I only need an informational copy of his birth record not a certified copy.

Thank you,
Annette Weiskircher",Email Request,Closed,Fulfilled in part,Not the Custodian,,10/30/2019 12:00:00 AM

34282,DEC,11/14/2019 12:00:00 AM,Robert Butani,"Dear Commissioner Boedecker; 

Yesterday, during a review of the ACT 250 website, I learned of Environmental Notice Bulletins (“ENB”) issued by your office to the Applicant (attached).   The ENBs are dated November 6 and November 8, 2019.  
I will note for the record that as an abutter to this project and one who has signed up to receive email notifications from your office, I have not received these ENB’s.   
Moreover I am not aware that any of my neighbors whose properties adjoin the project site or who live downstream from the discharge waters have received these ENB notices.  
 
This is very concerning to me.  

Please provide a specific response to each of the following requests:

-	Please explain why only the Applicant has been provided with current ENB notices.
-	Please explain why the applicable property owner and residents are similarly excluded form receiving the latest notices.
-	Were are the Applicant’s response to the public comments submitted on August 8, 2019? 

Pursuant to 1 V.S.A. § 317   please provide all documents and records that have not been posted to any ENB site including correspondence, electronic and otherwise,  sent and received between the State and the Permittee, Permittee’s agents and his representatives. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Bob

Subject: Town health officer question

Hi Melissa. I am the Town Health Officer in East Montpelier, and I am responsible for rental inspections.

I’m trying to find out how to determine if a landlord in my district has tested the water in his buildings. The landlord is not forthcoming.

How would I go about getting that information?

Subject: Children of Francis H. Ayers and Margaret Mary Bruyette Ayers concerning son Frank Ayers

Good morning,

I am looking for the siblings and relatives of my brother in law Frank Ayers 04/17/1958.  He's in hospice care.  He is the son of the late Francis Henry Ayers and Margaret Mary Bruyette Ayers.  His siblings include Ralph, Nina, Darlene and Brenda Ayers.  He may have a living aunt named Virginia (maiden name Ayers).  We have no contact information for the family members and he is not able to speak at this time.  If you will, please direct me to the appropriate services or people who may be able to help.  Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
Sand",Email Request,Closed,Fulfilled in part,Not the Custodian,,12/11/2019 12:00:00 AM

In accordance with Vermont's Public Record statutes, I am making a FOIA request for any and all records, communications and reports related to the  Medicare financial savings results for 2018 recently reported by OneCare Vermont to the Green Mountain Care Board. This request includes any and all communications between the Green Mountain Care Board members or staff and anyone else on this subject, including staff of OneCare Vermont. I seek all such records pertinent to the reported ACO Medicare financial results including reporting, explaining, discussion, calculation, revision or derivation of the ACO Medicare financial results for 2018. I am particularly interested in all calculations, communications and documents related to the establishment of the expected total cost of care and actual total cost of care for Medicare participants in OneCare for calendar year 2018. 

If any part of this request is unclear, please contact me immediately. Please let me know when I can inspect such records at your office. Should I wish copies of any such records I will inform you after my review of them. 

Sincerely,

Patrick Flood

Hello Bridgette, 
I am hoping you may be able to help me.
I am looking for Fire Code space occupancy for 
some of the multi-purpose rooms and gyms for
the schools in the Chittenden East Supervisory Union.
I am hoping that there is a record of this information.
I am new to my position and think this is information
I would like to have and display. I am looking through the records
here, but we recently moved and there is a lot to sort through.
Please let me know if you can help.
Thanks,

Good morning Ms. Mazza-Paquette,

This email is a formal request for a copy of the Vermont counties' “tax foreclosure excess funds list,” which I believe is maintained by your department. The excess funds to which I am referring are those arising in the case of a bid over the amount of the tax owed at the Tax Foreclosure or Trustee’s Foreclosure sale. I am looking for uncollected surplus funds from the following counties: Chittenden County and Washington County.

The information I need from the records is the foreclosure sale date, owner’s name, either the property address or owner’s mailing address, and the amount of surplus funds held. If you have these records in electronic format, I’d prefer the information that way. Otherwise, please let me know how much a hard copy of your list will be, and where and to whom to mail the check.

If you do not maintain a list of these surplus amounts, any advice on how I could collect that information from existing files you have would be very much appreciated!

If I have reached the wrong department, I would very much appreciate this letter being forwarded to the correct department.


Thank you in advance,
Christine Roy",Email Request,Closed,Fulfilled in part,Not the Custodian,,12/30/2019 12:00:00 AM

Hi Ms. Paquette,

Hi Ms. Lopes,

I am a student at the University of Connecticut conducting research with Professor Baggio, a health economist, about the effect of lyme disease in the northeast. I was wondering if you had a record of monthly cases of lyme disease, by county, in Vermont  from 2000 to 2019. On the website I only saw annual data by county, and not monthly.

Thank you very much.

35050,GMCB,01/08/2020 12:00:00 AM,Patrick Flood,"Thank you very much for the information you sent me on December 20. However, I found that it did not fully answer my questions. 

Clearly, for Medicare, the GMCB, CMS and OCV do not use the terminology ""expected total cost of care"". Instead a ""benchmark"" is developed and reviewed and agreed to by CMS for the fiscal year. However, it really is not clear how that benchmark is arrived at. I understand that for 2018 it was developed from the 2017 base year, with a trend, and estimates for attrition. However, nowhere in the document does it describe how the trend is developed or agreed upon. I would think this is crucial and would like to understand how it is derived. 

Also, the information I have shows that ACO was over budget in 2017 by $4.5 million. But in 2018, the benchmark number you supplied is substantially lower than 2017. What is the explanation?

In addition, clearly the $7.7 million for the Blueprint and SASH are agreed to up front, in 2018 and now in 2019 for 2020.How is it possible to agreed on $7.7 million in ""savings"" before the fiscal year even begins? It appears from what you supplied that this was agreed to in developing the benchmark for 2018. How is that ""savings""?.

Furthermore, I think the GMCB and OCV should be prepared to explain why savings occurred, in other words, what clinical or other interventions resulted in reduced spending in what expenditure areas. This is crucial to understand the success of the ACO. 

I would appreciate a follow up to your offer to meet with me. I don't think any of the documents available to date answer these questions, which I consider essential to understanding where savings come from and how they are derived. 

Thank you in advance for your cooperation and I look forward to hearing from you.

I called the VTDEC to ask about submitting a FOIA request and was told that you’re the best person to contact about it. I’d like
to request all environmental documents (tank records, hazardous waste records, spills and remediation) for the Energizer
(formerly Eveready Battery) facility at 401 Gage Street in Bennington, VT.
I’ve gone through the information available on the Vermont Environmental Research Tool and found several spill listings, three
Hazardous Waste Site listings (770098, 20053379, and 20063509), and a listing for a stormwater permit. I’m interested in any
documents you have beyond what is available online, and also anything else you have for this property that I may have missed.
Please let me know if there is an official request form I need to fill out, and if I will need to make an appointment to come in to
look at records. How long does it usually take to process records requests?
Thank you,
Marissa Drehobl

https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/ap-coordinators/exam-ordering-fees/exam-fees/federal-state-assistance/2018-19-details-by-state  
 
In this link it states a low SES student would pay $53 total for an AP exam (unless a particular school decides to subsidize further, the way I understand). I'm interested this number as far back as 2000. If there were no subsidies provided during certain years, I'm also interested in that information. So to make sure I'm clear, I'd like to know the $53 equivalent price for each year 2000-present. Or equivalently how much Vermont was willing to subsidize (in lieu of total price students are expected to pay which necessitates knowing College Board's subsidy price). 
 
Finally, I know some of these funds were earmarked specifically for the purpose of subsidizing AP exams. However, I was wondering if in general any other funding that also goes toward improving AP access for low-income students was granted in the same years as changes in subsidies. Basically, I would like to know if funding changes in subsidies are correlated in any way with other funding changes for AP courses in general. I know this might be out of the scope of your position, but if you could send me along, that would be great too.",Email Request,Closed,Fulfilled in part,Not the Custodian,,09/12/2019 12:00:00 AM

Hi Melissa, 

Is it possible to get my divorce date? My name when I was married was Michele Tubb. I took my maiden name back when I was divorced and is now and was then, Michele Coursen. My ex-husband’s name is Martin Tubb. We were married in Las Vegas, NV on 1/21/2001 and our divorce was finalized at the Windsor County Court House, I believe in 2006. 

If you need more information to find these records, please let me know. Thanks.

I am conducting research for Policy Matters Ohio, a non-partisan policy research institute. 

We are trying to assess how Ohio’s state-level capacity to address civil rights violations compares to other states. I would be grateful if you could answer the following questions. If you can not answer all of them, I’d be grateful if you answered the ones that you can answer easily: 
•	How many inspectors and or employees you currently employ?
•	How many complaints did you handle in 2017? In 2018? 
•	Are the only state-level agency in your state doing this work?
•	Do you receive state funding in addition to federal funding? If so, can you provide the amount you received in 2017 and 2018?
•	Finally, does your state extend protection beyond federally protected status of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age or disability? 
o	If so, which of the following are protected?: 
	pregnancy status, 
	genetic information, 
	marital status, 
	sexual orientation, 
	gender identity and expression, 
	AIDS/HIV status, 
	medical condition, 
	political affiliation, 
	military or veteran status, 
	status as a victim of domestic violence, assault or stalking
•	Are there other protected status categories in your state not listed above? If so, please list:

I would greatly appreciate your cooperation and hope to hear from you soon.

2.   Police Department - Chief Jennifer Frank (jennifer.frank@vermont.gov)
3.   Committees and committee members - various

We are attempting to confirm that the Town and its various departments have fulfilled the request(s) by checking the VT.Gov server and computer system to ensure that the Town of Norwich has been truthful and forthcoming in their responses.

Hello. My name is Eric Wienckowski and I am a former graduate student at the Limnological Research Center of the University

in lake sedimentation and coring studies.
During the course of my research, I have come across references to your bathymetric surveys on some lakes in Vermont. If it
isn't too much trouble, I would be interested in the following pieces of information concerning them:
1) Year conducted
2) Number of transects/soundings
3) Maximum depth recorded
4) Elevation of lake at time of survey
5) Any assistants on the surveys
I would also be interested in obtaining, if possible, datasets of the X,Y,Z sounding data.
Any information that you may be able to provide me with would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.

Thank you for the guidance.
Pursuant to the access to public records law, I'm looking for agency records from this year and last concerning water quality issues
related to dairy farms and/or enforcement actions in 2018 and 2019 against dairy farms.
As an example, the note below from Laura DiPietro at the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets mentions one complaint filed
this year against a farm, and that this complaint was deemed to be a direct discharge and referred to ANR. So I'm looking for this
enforcement action, related documents, and any agency records from ANR regarding dairy farms and water quality concerns in
2018 and 2019.
In addition, I am requesting agency records related to the Vorsterveld Farm in Ferrisburgh and Panton. I know the agency has
already released documents to attorney Rob Woolmington related to this farm, so hopefully these records have already been
compiled. I am specifically interested in how complaints that the farm violated wetlands regulations, or discharged waste directly
into waterways, were addressed or resolved.
I can be reached at 223-4685 or 802 373-6615 if you have any questions.

Good afternoon.
My name is Ralph Perkins and I live in Colchester.
The Town of Colchester has been working on a sewer project for 289 lakeshore properties along Malletts Bay. Last March the voters rejected the bond request by the select board.
I believe the grants / loans from the State are still available to them for this project if they get it past the voters this March. I am interested to see the town’s argument for public funds and how the State weighed costs and benefits before approving funds. For example, how did E coli factor into the State’s criteria to approve the grant? Other factors?
What information would I need to provide to you so that you would be able to provide me with the grant/loan approval documents? I believe the Town has been approved for both a “Clean Water State Revolving Loan” and a “Pollution Control Grant.”

To Melissa Mazza-Paquette, 
I hope this finds you well. My name is Jessica Gray, and I am reaching out on behalf of PitchBook Data's research team. I am currently seeking updated quarterly performance data from your plan’s alternative asset holdings for the following date(s): 1Q2010 through the most recent available report. 
Thank you in advance for the time you take in sending me the responsive documents, and if there is another person or distribution email I should resend this to, please let me know. Below follows the formal request. 
On behalf of PitchBook Data, Inc., under Vermont Public Records Law, I request a copy of the quarterly public records from 1Q 2010 through the most recent available report for the following information, preferably in Excel or PDF format. 
1. Names and vintage years of all private equity, venture capital, mezzanine, distressed, real estate/REIT, debt and infrastructure partnerships in Vermont Pension Investment Committee's portfolio. 
2. Commitments made to each partnership. 
3. Contributions drawn down since inception. 
4. Distributions made to Vermont Pension Investment Committee to date by each individual partnership. 
5. Net Asset Value of each partnership. 
6. Internal rates of return (IRRs) for each partnership with and without the use of credit facility. Please note if the IRRs are not net. 
7. Investment multiple (TV/PI) for each individual partnership. 
8. The dollar amount of “total management fees and costs paid” for each individual partnership. 
9. Date as of which all the above data was calculated. 
10. Names of all alternative asset partnerships partially and fully sold by Vermont Pension Investment Committee, including date of sale. 
11. For each fund, please indicate whether or not the fund uses Subscription Credit Facilities. 
I also request a copy of any documents which contain some or all of the following information: 
12. Names of all hedge fund holdings (including hedge fund of funds) in Vermont Pension Investment Committee's portfolio. 
13. Month by Month Market Value for each hedge fund holding (including hedge fund of funds) since Vermont Pension Investment Committee's initial investment up to 2Q 2018.

15. Month by Month Returns (net of fees) earned by Vermont Pension Investment Committee for each hedge fund holding (including hedge fund of funds) since initial investment up to 2Q 2018. 
If there are any fees for searching for, reviewing, or copying the records, please inform me before you task the request. If you deny all or any part of this request, please cite each specific exemption you think justifies your refusal to release the information and notify me of appeal procedures available under the law.

35815,DOC,01/29/2020 12:00:00 AM,Mark Flatten,"I am surveying multiple state agencies, cities and school districts as to their practices concerning what is commonly known as “official time” or “release time.” This is where representatives of public employee unions or labor organizations are given paid time off from their regular government duties to perform union work. For illustrative purposes, this is similar to the practice in the federal government documented here:
https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/labor-management-relations/reports-on-official-time/
 
To that end, I am asking that you provide me with documentation disclosing the following information for each and every department within your agency, and for the most recently concluded fiscal year:
-          Name of the union or unions representing employees of the department.
-          Total number of hours of official/release time permitted by the department, specified by union or bargaining unit.
-          Total cost of all official/release time for your department, including salary and all benefits.
-          The specific section in each labor agreement that allows for official/release time for each department, as well as copies of the relevant portions of those agreements. If those agreements are already available online, please direct me to the web address and the appropriate section.
-          Any reports documenting, describing or explaining the use of release time prepared for the governing body (i.e. governor, legislature) or management (i.e. agency director)
-          Any policies or practices related to the use of release time by your department.
-          The amount of the cost of release time that was paid by the union or bargaining unit, either directly or through reimbursement to your agency
 
Again for illustrative purposes, I am attempting to compile a database similar to that published by the federal Office of Personnel Management through weblink above, but focusing on state and local entities. In processing this request, it may be helpful for you to review the OPM’s format in the link, particularly the last dozen or so pages of each annual report which documents for each agency the total number of official time hours, their uses and costs in both salary and benefits. In the 2016 report, this table is found under Appendix B beginning on Page 19 of the PDF.  While I understand that you may not have an obligation to create new records, this approach may be easier for your agency than sending copies of all relevant records on which the information requested above appears.  
 
In addition, for each employee who used 500 or more hours or official/release time in the last full fiscal year, please provide the following information:
-          Employee name
-          Location (city or facility)
-          Union name
-          Job Title
-          Total number of official/release time hours used, by fiscal year, for each of the five past fiscal years
-          Annual cost in salary and benefits for official time for for each of the five past fiscal years
-          The amount of the cost of release time that was paid by the union or bargaining unit, either directly or through reimbursement to your agency
-          Any specific reports filed by the employee describing how the release time was used
 
To be clear, while this practice is generally referred to as official or release time, I am seeking this information about that or any similar practice which allows public employees to be released from their regular duties to do work for their union while drawing salary and benefits from public entities, regardless of what you may call it.",Email Request,Closed,Fulfilled in whole,,,

I’m a student at New York University, and am writing to ask if it is possible to obtain daily emergency department and inpatient health data for the state of Vermont for use in a student’s dissertation project. Because the nature of the project involves linking daily air pollution levels to daily emergency department data, we cannot use data provided by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) since the “admission date” variable is censored in their product. For this student’s project, data will be aggregated to the city level and no identifiable information made public. 
 
Thank you for your help, and please let me know if you have any questions.

I’d like to submit a public records request with the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation. I’d like to request the following information (if possible) for the property at: 1 Scale Avenue, Rutland, Vermont

•	Records of site subsurface investigations
•	Records of site cleanup or remediation
•	Records of chemical or oil spills at the facility, and any spill response
•	Underground or Aboveground Storage Tank records
•	VT DEC inspections of the facility
Hi Jean,

Absolutely. Here is the additional information:

1.	This is a big property that’s had a colored history, so there’s a few different numbers:
a.	7755541
b.	770072
c.	870130
d.	WMD254
e.	WMD101
f.	WMD580
g.	2735
2.	I found the site on the GIS map, but I’m not sure what type of information we’re looking for on this map. Let me know if I need to look up anything specific for it
3.	Unfortunately the information I have right now indicates that the spills associated with above numbers happened in the 1980s, so I think I’ll need information back at least to then if possible. 

Thank you very much for your help with this, please let me know if I can provide any other information!",Email Request,Closed,Not Fulfilled,Not the Custodian,,01/17/2020 12:00:00 AM
36528,DEC,01/21/2020 12:00:00 AM,James Dumont,"Ms. Nicolai, I am writing to you as a person listed on the Department's website as a public records officer.  I am cc'ing Attorney Beling.

The City of Montpelier, in conjunction with the Capitol Plaza, is planning a parking garage at the intersection of the Winooski River and the North Branch.  This location is subject to periodic flooding.   According to the engineering documents filed with the District Commission, the bottom two floors of the proposed parking garage site will be lower than the Base Flood Elevation. One floor will be 7.8 feet below Base Flood Elevation; the other will be 13.8 feet below Base Flood Elevation.  Dubois & King Response to Act 250 Recess Memo Flood Related Criterion 1(D), Ronald C. Lyon, February 25, 2019, p.3.  The site lies within the 100-year floodplain of the Winooski River and North Branch rivers. Base Flood Elevation refers to 100-year storms.   Although the two floors will be substantially lower (7.8 and 13.8 feet) than the 100-year storm elevation, nothing filed by the applicant addresses how frequently these floors will be flooded during 1-year, 10-year, 25-year or 50-year storms.   

According to the application documents, the parking garage is designed so that during flooding the waters of the Winooski River will flow through the two bottom levels of the parking garage.  See Dubois & King memo, above.  That is, the design of the garage will allow the river's waters to flow into the building and then back out. 

The Clean Water Act states that a ""point source"" is: ""any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, including but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, or vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants are or may be discharged.""  ""Discharges"" include ""any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source."" Vermont's Water Pollution Permit Regulations adopt these definitions.  The regulations and state statutes require that an individual discharge permit be obtained for any point source discharge. 

The plans for the garage include one or more discernible, confined and discrete conveyances, including but not limited to pipes, ditches, channels, conduits, wells, discrete fissures, and/or containers, that will collect waste materials from the floors of the parking garage and that will be open to the waters of the river during the expected flooding.  These include what in common parlance would be called a holding tank and/or trenches.  The waste materials are likely to include the commonly encountered components of  parking lot runoff -- lead, zinc, copper, salt, sediment, anthropogenic organic compounds, nutrients, and microbial contaminants, which can be harmful to human and aquatic life. [1]

The collection of these pollutants in pipes, ditches, channels, conduits, wells, discrete fissures, and/or containers, and then the discharge of them into the river during the expected flooding, appears to require an individual discharge permit.  The federal courts have held that runoff that is ""collected or channeled by human beings"" constitutes a ""point source.""  

I am writing, therefore, under the Public Records Act, to request copies of all documents, including memoranda and reports, and also including all communications such as letters or emails with the City, with Capitol Plaza or with any other agency or person, that pertain to: 

a) whether a point source (NPDES) permit is required or is not required for this parking garage;

b) whether a point source permit may be applied for, is being applied for, or should be applied for; or 

c) the contents or potential contents of all individual discharge permits or draft individual discharge permits.

Please let me know if this request would be unduly time-consuming or burdensome.  If so, I will try to narrow the request.  Also please let me know if the request would benefit from clarification.  Thanks.",Email Request,Closed,Not Fulfilled,Records Do Not Exist,,02/05/2020 12:00:00 AM

I'd like to please request your agency's entire database on all wastewater spills or accidental releases —  in all its forms whether treated, untreated or raw sewage — from your current digital system with all dates, locations and all other column fields. If it’s necessary to limit the request to certain dates, we are requesting everything between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2019. 
 
If the data is kept separately, I'd also like to request the agency's database on fines and any other penalties for those releases. 

For the above databases, I'd like to request any documentation, such as a data dictionary that describes the fields and how they relate to each other. 

We would need the records in an electronic format that can be imported into standard database software.

Per our data guru, examples of such formats include an Excel .xls or .xlsx file, an Access .mdb or .accdb file, a text-based delimited file such as .csv or tab-delimited .txt, a .dbf file or an SQL dump readable by standard open-source database software. (A PDF file would not comply with this request because PDF files are not readable by database software.) If this information is stored in a relational database, I request it be provided in its original relational format, not ""flattened"" or de-normalized.  

Here's my phone number if I can answer any questions: 386-801-5814
If there are fees associated with this request, please let me know in advance. However, we would request a waiver of any fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and would contribute significantly to the public's understanding.

My name is Michael Frett and I'm a reporter at the St. Albans Messenger.

I'm writing this morning to ask if there was an available recording of yesterday's Green Mountain Care Board meeting? We're hoping to have a story on the GMCB's decision yesterday regarding NMC's proposed rate hike for tomorrow's Messenger.

Is this a request you would be able to help me with? If not, I apologize in advance for the inconvenience and would you be able to point me toward the person I should be reaching out to for a recording?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Many thanks,

Hello,

My name is Ethan Bakuli and I’m a reporter with the Burlington Free Press. I am requesting a list of statewide contracts that have started their terms between March 25 until today. I have been combing through the Agency of Administration’s website, so I’m aware that pdfs of executed contracts are available but I wasn’t sure if I could be able to receive a list organized by the most recent dates.

EXTERNAL SENDER: Do not open attachments or click on links unless you recognize and trust the sender.
Good morning,
My name is Finlay Buchanan-Jacobs, and I am a student at the University of Vermont.

I am emailing you to inquire about the Vermont Public Records Act, and several requests for financial documents that I have filed with the presiding officer (Gary Derr). I have, on multiple occasions, attempted to procure documents relating to the current financial state of the University of Vermont, with the intent of better understanding the need for UVM’s recent faculty time and pay cuts. I have received no response from Mr. Derr to these requests, which as I understand is a violation of state law and constitutes a misdemeanor charge. It is my hope that you can provide the documents that I have requested, or provide me further information on how to press charges against Mr. Derr, if he continues to fail to comply with state law and I am unable to attain the documents.

I understand this is a difficult time for all involved, but it frustrates me immensely that UVM is obstructing independent investigation into their finances, especially at a time when UVM intends to cut salaries of low paid employees and leave many employees below the Vermont Livable Standard while maintaining exorbitant administrative salaries.

I would greatly appreciate any further insight that you could provide on this issue.

I hope you and your family are staying safe and healthy during this difficult time.

Best Wishes,

I have a couple requests for you. I'd like to call into the meeting tomorrow morning via skype. 

Secondly, I was told that the GMCB had the latest figures for CARES act allocation by hospital. Is that on the site? I haven't seen it. If you could point me to it, or send it to me, that'd be much appreciated! 

Thanks very much. Enjoy the stunning weather.

Hello, 

I’m looking to make a public records request pertaining to the sale of Marlboro College’s campus that happened recently, do you know who would be best to contact about that?

Good afternoon!
 
I'm making an official record request for a list of all active, licenced establishments for cosmetology / salons and barber shops to include the business name, owner name, phone number, email address, and business address if possible. An excel or CSV file would be great.
 
This comes with a huge Please and Thank You!
 
Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

37193,GMCB,06/09/2020 12:00:00 AM,Jason Weiss,"Good Afternoon Ms. Connolly, 

I am a research assistant for Jill R. Horwitz, a Professor of Law at UCLA School of Law and a productive scholar in the fields of health policy and economics. Part of my research has included evaluating Certificate of Need laws throughout the country and understanding how they may regulate CT and MRI scanners.  

Would you have a few minutes to speak with me on the phone about Vermont's CON law? Or could you answer a few questions over email? I would be very grateful if you could provide some clarification on the following: 

1. Can you confirm that Vermont’s CON law regulates CT/MRI scanners if they cost in excess of $1.5 million (for hospitals) and $1 million (for a health care facility other than a hospital)? 

2. It is my understanding that a CON is required if a freestanding diagnostic imaging center or independent physicians group (not associated with a hospital) wanted to buy an MRI/CT scanner in excess of $1 million. Is that correct? 

3. Can you confirm when the current CON law was enacted?

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon. 

All the best,

Jason Weiss

Good afternoon, 

I was just made aware on Friday that OneCare Vermont has disclosed salary information that was not due to services performed for OneCare Vermont, and is covered by a confidentiality agreement.  This was done without prior notification, and the error occurred due to the GMCB's instructions to pull salary information from UVMMC's W2.  

It is important to note that I provided work for other entities that was simply processed through a professional services agreement by UVMMC - completely unrelated to OneCare Vermont and is not relevant to the information you seek and is damaging to me personally if it were publicly disclosed. 

I therefore respectfully request that only the portion of my salary related to OneCare Vermont be publicly disclosed and none of the salary related to any other entity.

Thank you for your consideration,

I believe Nicole York sent me the records through July 1, 2017, though I need to get into my office to check on that, hopefully tomorrow. (We are working from remote still.) But for now my request is for all records since July 1, 2017.

Also, could you tell me if there are any inspections or followup inspections planned for that building and who is doing them and when, please.

Thank you.

Is it possible to get aggregate or compiled data on speeding tickets from traffic cameras as well as speeding tickets given by police department officers? Specifically, what I'm after is seeing if there is parity along racial/ethnic and gender lines for speeding tickets. And I think that using traffic camera data could be a good control. 
Are there ways to look at this data without names, license plate numbers, or other identifying information? I don't want to infringe on others' right to privacy. 
Are these data available to civilians? Do I need to file a FOIA request?
I've never done this before, so if I am going about this in the wrong way, please tell me and I'll amend what I've done.

Hello,

My name is Ellie Burdick, and I am an intern for EdChoice, a school choice non-profit.  I'm requesting the public documents of the Teachers Retirement System Annual Actuarial Valuation Reports for the years 1980-2000.  The reason for request is data collection and analysis.

To Whom It May Concern,

I would like to submit a request for the documents below, preferably as scanned PDFs or soft copies.

(1) Requests for quotes or proposals (RFQs or RFPs) related to inmate telecommunication services from 2000-2019, including the evaluation criteria for RFPs/RFQs.

(2) For each RFP/RFQ issued, all of the corresponding responses received from ITS providers (including those that did not win the contract).

(3) Corresponding documents, reports, and spreadsheets that evaluate responses to the RFQs or RFPs by telecommunication providers, including any ""scoring"" of the quality of the responses.

(4) Contracts with inmate telecommunications providers, and any modifications to those contracts.

(5) Detailed inmate historical call volume information, including the number of calls and total minutes of use for Local, InterLATA, IntraLATA, and Interstate calls for each facility, for each month, from 2000-2019.

(6) Average Daily Population on a monthly basis at each facility over this time period (2000-2019).

Please let me know if any of the above is unclear, or if it would be more appropriate to direct my request elsewhere. 

Best,
Nathan",Email Request,Closed,Fulfilled in part,Not the Custodian,,07/08/2020 12:00:00 AM

Also a third road that I believe was a “County” road extended into Spooner’s Gore from the town of  Royalton, Windsor County.  In Royalton it is referred to as the Bloss- Bleau road and has had some fairly recent legal action to reestablish it by the Town or Royalton.

The context is I want to be able to quantify the number of times the Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Airvo medical device has been approved for reimbursement under the E1399 HCPCS code, with as many details as possible, but with the patient’s protected health information being omitted. I request any records starting from January 1st 2016 until today’s date.

I will accept the information in whichever format is possible (either individual records or a list). If a list is put together, I request the following to be included:
•           Date of Service
•           Date of Payment
•           Primary diagnosis and secondary diagnoses (if applicable)
•           If patient Date of Birth is protected, Year of birth or (approximate) Age should be included
•           Geographical information (i.e. City & State)
•           Name of physician and/or physician practice
•           Name of durable medical equipment provider (DME Provider)

If it is impossible to search all of these records, I am able to provide a list of businesses which may have received reimbursement, which may help making obtaining the records simpler.",Email Request,Open,,,,

Hope you had a good weekend. I'm writing to request two documents related to OneCare. 
First, I believe CMS will be sending a warning to the GMCB after OCV failed to meet the scale targets for two (nearly three) years in a row. Do you have that warning? Is that something you could send to me? 
The budget presentation also mentioned an OCV memo coming on potential changes to the risk model for 2020. Is that something that GMCB already has? 
If or when it's available, would you mind sharing it with me? 
 
As you can see, I'm not clear on when the board is receiving these documents... 
Thanks, 
Katie",Email Request,Closed,Not Fulfilled,,,08/11/2020 12:00:00 AM

37929,PSD,08/18/2020 12:00:00 AM,James Dumont,"I am making a PRA request based on Paragraph 12 of the Order issued by the Commission on 12/23/13 in Docket 7970, the ANGP case.  Paragraph 12 states:

12. VGS shall develop an aggressive new energy  efficiency program for its new customers in Addison County and present it to the Board for review and approval. One goal of this program shall be to invest the projected $ 200 million dollar savings into energy  efficiency transitions that will facilitate, rather than frustrate, achieving the 90% renewable   energy  goal by 2050. At a minimum, VGS needs to ensure that its proposal addresses three issues: (1) its new industrial (and residential) customers  in Addison County and the shaping of their energy  efficiency future; (2) the opportunity for savings by industrial customers  in energy  efficiency technology as they invest in conversion to natural gas  (e.g., replacing old technology with more efficient technology rather than simply converting it to natural gas) ; and (3) ensuring that the investment of VGS ratepayers in the Project results in not only reliability and greater availability of natural gas to new customers  but also greater energy  efficiency (and reduced GhG emissions)  for new and existing customers.


The word ""reduced,""  as I understand it means reduced from present levels.  I can think of no other reasonable interpretation.  The reference to ""GhG"" refers to all greenhouse gasses, not just carbon, as is evident from the rest of the Order.  As the Department knows, carbon is just one GhG. Methane is another, far more harmful GhG. 

I have searched the public documents on the Commission's website and VGS's website and find no proposal that invests $200 million into energy efficiency or that ""ensure[s] that the investment of VGS ratepayers in the Project results in not only reliability and greater availability of natural gas to new customers but also greater energy efficiency (and reduced GhG emissions) for new and existing customers."" 

All that I have found that pertains to the 7970 Order is the April 2015 Order of Appointment of VGS as an EEU that states that VGS compliance with the Order in Docket 7970 will be addressed in a future proceeding.  No such future proceeding could I find.

With that as background, here are my requests.  

First, please provide me with every document that  VGS has filed with, served on or sent to the Department that pertains to any VGS proposal that ensures that investment of VGS ratepayers' funds in the ANGP is resulting in or will result in reductions of the GhG emissions of new and existing customers, and also every other communication from or to the Department about whether or how VGS is proposing to use the investment by ratepayers in the ANGP to reduce the GhG emissions of new and existing customers. 

Second, if not encompassed in the first request,  please provide me with every document that  VGS has filed with, served on or sent to the Department that pertains to how VGS is spending, has spent, or will spend the $200 million referred to in the Order, or any part of that sum, on ensuring reduced GhG emissions by new and existing customers, and also every other communication from or to the Department about this subject. 


Third, if not encompassed by the prior requests, please provide me with every document that DPS possesses that pertains to whether or not, in fact, the ANGP has resulted in, is resulting in, or will result in reduced emissions of GhG by VGS's existing or new customers.  This request pertains not to just communications with VGS but to all nonprivileged documents in DPS possession.


If these requests are confusing or would be burdensome, please let me know and I will clarify or narrow them.  Thank you.",Email Request,Closed,Fulfilled in part,,,

Good Morning,

I am reaching out to seek clarification on percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)/cardiac catheterization, open heart surgery (OHS), and electrophysiology (EP) service line regulations in Vermont. Specifically, if a hospital wished to start offering these services, would they have to complete a special application, letter of intent, or a special regulatory process in order to do so? If regulated, what requirements would the hospital need to meet? I have listed more specific questions below. I greatly appreciate any help and insight that you would be able to provide. Thank you so much.

•	Is a hospital allowed to do percutaneous coronary intervention/cardiac catheterizations under any circumstance without open heart surgery on-site? Does this also pertain to electrophysiology procedures?
o	Will you please direct me to the online link that holds the regulatory information for cardiac catheterizations? Thank you.
•	What exactly are the requirements and process to start offering cardiac surgery/open heart surgery at a hospital? 
o	Will you please direct me to the online link that holds the regulatory information for cardiac/open heart surgery? Thank you.
•	Is there any specific regulated stroke system or stroke protocol that EMS in Vermont must follow and that hospitals can be designated? Thank you.

I'm trying to find out whether Vermont's proposed state budget includes any changes to funding for medication assisted treatment programs or other services for Vermonters struggling with addiction. I understand that other states have cut funding for such treatment and care because of revenue losses due to the pandemic, even while the pandemic has contributed to increases in overdoses.

Can you tell me whether the current budget proposal would cut funding for treatment, or perhaps includes increased funding to address substance use disorder? Or, could you point me to someone who would know these answers?",Email Request,Open,,,,

38446,GMCB,09/14/2020 12:00:00 AM,Julie Wasserman,"Dear Sarah and Marisa,
Greetings. I sent this email below to Alena but her automatic reply encouraged me to sent it to you in her absence.

I am writing to get some clarification on OneCare’s new primary care reimbursement plan/s for 2021. Please let me know if I have mis-stated anything. I look forward to receiving your answers to my questions.

OneCare’s Original Plan
•	Provides an upfront payment of $1.75 with the potential to rise to $4.75. 
•	After the ACO year concludes, primary care practices would receive an additional $1.50 if the ACO meets its “target” (no gains or losses) $1.75 + $1.50 = $3.25. 
•	If the ACO achieves “savings”, the primary care practices would receive an additional $1.50. ($3.25 + $1.50 = $4.75).
•	Please help me understand which categories of primary care practices are subject to OneCare’s Original Plan. All primary care participating with OneCare. CPR program is available only to independent primary care practices. Please explain what you mean in the previous sentence. Could you please define “CPR” and distinguish it from OneCare’s Original Plan.

OneCare/Healthfirst Agreement
•	Provides an upfront payment of $3.25 with $1.50 of that sum “at risk”.
•	After the ACO year concludes, “If the ACO does not meet its performance goals per payer, the practice will be required to pay back the balance owed up to $1.50.”
•	How does OCV define “performance goals”?  Financial? Quality? Other? Performance goals defined in payer contracts.
•	Does the OCV/Healthfirst agreement still allow for the “up to $4.75 PM/PM” if the ACO achieves “savings”? I see why you ask; I am not sure and need to confirm but I believe yes, the opportunity to receive the additional $1.50 up to the $4.75 would still be available. Please confirm and let me know.
•	This agreement applies only to “independent primary care practices facing economic stress”.
•	How will “economic stress” be established? Will OCV make that determination? I do not have additional information on this at this time. Based on testimony and the language I interpret this as Covid-19 hardship which affects all and allows any practice to select this option, but I would need to confirm. Please confirm and let me know.
•	Are the FQHCs, non-Healthfirst independent practices, and hospital-based primary care physicians in or out of the OCV/Healthfirst agreement? Again, I see why you ask based on the language and I need to confirm but I believe it applies to any primary care. Please confirm and let me know. You stated above: “All primary care participating with OneCare” are subject to OneCare’s Original Plan. But here you say the FQHCs, non-Healthfirst independent practices, and the hospital-based primary care physicians are subject to the OCV/Healthfirst Plan. Please clarify.   CPR program is available to any independent primary care. Please explain this last sentence.

Thank you for your assistance.

Hello Melissa,
I am hoping you can lead me in the right direction.  Previously we have requested reports and received them from Thom Combs.  When I sent a follow up email I received a message that email no longer works.  Please let me know who I should contact to get the information.  This is what we are currently requesting.

I am looking for the excel file that contains all storage tanks in the state of Vermont including “Above Ground Storage Tanks”, “Underground Storage Tanks” and also the “Unknown” or unclassified storage tanks.  The last information we received was in Sept 2018 and included the following columns of information.  I have also attached a small sample of the last file we received. 

Structure Id
Structure
Addr1
Addr2
City
State
Zip
Tank Workitem Id
Tank State Number
Tank Serial Number

Location
Tank Type
Gallons

I appreciate your help.  Please let me know if you have any questions.


Sincerely,

Hello Health Surveillance Division of Vermont and AOA Records Officers/Liaisons,
 
I work for Brigham and Women’s Hospital in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics. We are looking to find a way to receive death data by working with the state governments to get individualized death data from their respective offices (i.e. not NDI / federal information) for research purposes. For example, given an identifier (like a full name or Social Security number), we would like to be able to identify the death date (if any) for that individual. 
Please let me know if there is any established method to receive death data from Vermont for research purposes. I apologize in advance if you are not the appropriate person to contact- if possible, please forward my request to any relevant department or personnel.
Thank you!
Best,
Lily Bessette

Subject: FOIA Request

To whom it may concern,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sophia Albanese and I am a research assistant at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology conducting research on telemedicine reimbursement rates in the United States. My team, led by Dr. Amar Gupta of MIT, is working in an intensive mode to collect information from FOIA surrounding the rates at which telemedicine services are being reimbursed in each state. Many state websites provide the fee schedules and CPT/HCPCS codes that are reimbursable for telemedicine, however, my team is looking for information indicating the monetary rates these services are commonly being reimbursed by national, state, and private insurers. 

This email serves as our request to receive information via FOIA about your state's reimbursement data on services for telemedicine as they compare to in-person services. The ideal form of information would provide the gross data of the reimbursement rates for services provided in-person as well as the rates of reimbursement for those same services provided via telemedicine. Please note that this request is for the actual rates these services are being reimbursed for, not the intended rate that is prescribed through state parity laws. For instance, are telemedicine services being reimbursed at the same rate, lower, or higher than in-person rates for the same services?

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration. Please contact me with any questions. If you believe my request is better served for another member of your department, I would greatly appreciate it if you would share this request with the correct individuals.

We’re looking for some assistance with respect to a Fire Safety inspection on 52 Jericho Road, Richmond, Vermont.  I represent Tom Eaton, who purchased the property on August 28.  In conjunction with his purchase, we held money from the Seller to address fire safety inspection issued that might come up based on a Fire Safety inspection done on or about September 1.

We’re now more than a month past the inspection date and my client still has not been provided with a copy of the inspection report.  I just spoke with Brian Drouin at the Williston office and he claims that the report cannot be provided because it contains “non-public information” and for me to reach out to the Barre office.

Frankly speaking, this is absolutely unacceptable.  The need for public safety far outweighs any privacy concerns.  Furthermore, our client actually owns the property and has an absolute right to see the inspection report for the property he owns.  I would hate to imagine the public reaction if there was a fire with significant property damage, or even resulting in a death, and the Division of Fire Safety was not releasing the results of an inspection that occurred over a month prior.  Please provide us with a copy of the report immediately.  Thank you,

Jon Stebbins

Ms. Susanne Young
Secretary of Administration
State of Vermont.

[Nutshell excerpt:]
""It is reckless, irresponsible and unsafe to proceed with the NG911 procurement at this time under these circumstances.""

Please send me a copy of the Gartski Consulting report completed as the required Independent Expert Review which was due on January 9, 2019 on the proposed NG-911 system in accordance with the attached contract/Statement of Work which you delegated to Kristy Pirie who then provided it to me on December 5, 2018.

I call to your attention the fact that the prior Independent Review (IR) conducted in 2014 by BerryDunn of the FairPoint 911 system failed to include an analysis of the redundancy and reliability of the underlying telecommunications transport network. This is due to the E911 Board having arbitrarily narrowed the definition of the NG911 system to being just the overlay network inside the FairPoint NG911 gateway, thereby neglecting to address reliability and redundancy of the underlying transport relying on the FairPoint network elements spanning Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine! 

That enormous error and omission has resulted in recurring failures of the FairPoint 911 system and also left the State of Vermont with no ability to assess financial penalties or recover damages from FairPoint due to the Service Level Agreements not being in effect at the time. This 'accountability gap' was due to ""Final Acceptance"" by the E911 Board of the FairPoint system not having occurred despite being several years into the contract term. 

One significant example of unrecovered or unrecoverable costs is the extensive regulatory proceedings and hiring of experts to litigate the PUC investigations into these failures, in Dockets 8390 and 8850.

Independent Reviewer BerryDunn's  2014 IER report forewarned of some of these issues with the completed contract terms being unavailable to the reviewer and the systems fundamental reliance on the SLAs. Yet these critical red flags were ignored. 

The Public Utility Commission has Docket 8850, an open investigation into the failures of the FairPoint transport and routing network, much of which will likely be relied upon by any new NG911 vendor.  

Chronic vulnerabilities which continue to leave a number of communities periodically isolated from a FairPoint host switch and unable to complete any 911 calls whatsoever is another issue that both the PUC and the E911 Board have for years failed to address or resolve.

This accountability gap necessitates that a comprehensive network analysis be completed by a qualified telecommunications network engineer of both the next proposed NG911 system but also the underlying transport network reliability and redundancy. This long overdue task must NOW be completed in the interest of public safety. 
[SEE Transcript of October 30, 2018 E911 Board meeting on pages 13-19 regarding still unresolved isolation events blocking 911 call delivery. Filed at PUC as public comment in Docket 8850]

If Comtech or CenturyLink is the yet unidentified selected vendor now in negotiations with the E911 Board and Purchasing staff, it is noteworthy that CenturyLink years ago acquired Level3 which had itself prior acquired the Vermont fiber network assets of Hyperion/Adelphia. The Level3 network in Vermont has, to my knowledge, never before been used to support an Enhanced 911 systems and as such the importance of a complete engineering network analysis both within and beyond the 911 system boundary defined by the Enhanced 911 Board must be completed. The same required analysis of redundancy and reliability which has still not yet completed for the Consolidated network has NEVER been completed for the Level3 network in Vermont! 

These are tasks which are clearly not included in the attached Scope of Work for the proposed NG911 system Independent Review and I suspect are also far beyond the skill level of Paul Gartski as a so-called independent reviewer. 

Even were BerryDunn to be retained again for the IR with a broader Scope of Work, they would almost certainly require additional funding to retain telecom engineering expertise to complete such an extensive analysis. This would likely be beyond the arbitrary cost limitations defined by Purchasing for these statutorily required Independent Expert Reviews as are documented in the State ""Purchasing Handbook"".

The Enhanced 911 Board was last year forewarned that expert analysis should be retained prior to issuance of the  NG911 RFP and it was not, my advice again being simply ignored. It is reckless, irresponsible and unsafe to proceed with the NG911 procurement at this time under these circumstances.

I also hereby officially request a copy of the Statement of Qualifications for Paul Gartski to conduct IRs for the State of Vermont, specifically applicable to telephone network infrastructure engineering and NG911 systems or services.

Kind regards,

On a date approximately one year ago, my aide, Ellery Morrell, and I were at the Department of Motor Vehicles office directly behind the Rutland State Police Barracks.  We initial called to report that the handicapped parking spaces directly in front of that DMV office were occupied by vehicles not displaying the International Handicapped symbol either on the vehicle’s license plate or the placard in the area of the from windshield, mirror, visor, and/or dashboard area.  I requested a) the telephone recording, radio dispatching recording, citation/summons/warning/incident report and any other “record” defined under title 1 V.S.A sections 316 – 319 et seq.
 
2.	I subsequently telephone multiple times as soon as my aide, Ellerey Morrell and I got finished with our business at DMV in Rutland concerning a vehicle which was parked perhaps 2” from our vehicle’s passenger side door which obviously violated Vermont V&T laws being out of bounds in its vehicle space preventing anyone from entering our passenger’s side door.  On the driver’s side of our vehicle THAT VEHICLE likewise also a few inches into our space.  Please note that both Mr. Morrell and I both are disabled.  He is obese and has a mobility problem.  I am an amputee – missing 1/3 of my left leg and entire foot on my left side.  We called and had to wait in the poring rain and two state troopers (male and female) finally responded.  I asked as in the previous above request all records including reports, telephone records, reports, citations/summons and any other writings, recordings, photographs, etc.
 
3.	I requested to view copies and reports/records concerning any type of enforcement by the Vermont State Police to show any enforcement of handicapped parking throughout the entire State of Vermont.
 
4.	I requested to view any and all records relating to me from the beginning of record keeping up through and including the date of full compliance. My date of birth is 02/10/1950;
 
5.	I requested to view any reports/records concerning each and every barracks as well as headquarters of the Vermont State Police which shows or tends to show compliance with all provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act (“ADA”) including but not limited to the requirements of handicapped parking, counter height, written directors including relating to hearing/visually impair individuals, etc.
 
6.	I requested to view directives to staff in order to comply with the requirements of 47 C.F.R. section 90.425 et seq.
 
7.	I requested to view for any radio used by the Vermont State Police a list of the special identifiers to be used by the mobile units. (i.e. unit numbers;
 
8.	I requested to view any record which would show any of the following information regarding ANY employee of the Vermont State Police:
 
1.	Employee’s full name;
2.	Employee’s full title;
3.	Employee’s official title;
4.	Employee’s physical work address including street address, suite number or other designation;

Would either of you, or someone else, be able to tell me how many complaints about Southern Vermont Cable Co. were received from those towns last year from July 1, 2019, to Oct. 1, 2019?

Again, the towns are: Dummerston, Jamaica, Newfane, Putney, Townshend and Dover. 

I'm trying to determine how the 17 complaints compare to the number before the Comcast sale, so that I can properly contextualize the complaints this year. If there's another way to quantify this, I'd appreciate that, too — i.e., how significant is 17 complaints from those towns about one company in a three-month period?

 Re: Independent Review of proposed NG911 system report.

Pursuant to Vermont Access to Public Records Laws, 1 V.S.A. §§ 315 et. seq., I hereby APPEAL TO THE HEAD OF THE AGENCY the denial of access to the Independent Expert Review of the NG911 system proposal requested from you on January 11, 2019. 

The Independent Expert Review of major IT systems and services are required of your office by statute in 3 V.S.A. 2222 (g). Ms. Mazza's misdirection or attempt to restart the statutory clock for production of a public record by suggesting erroneously that ADS is responsible for these reports is clearly erroneous in that the proposed Bill attempting to make that change died in Committee last biennium.

The three business days clock has since lapsed for you to claim the need for a ten day extension or need to additional time for consultation with other agencies or the Attorney General or to complete redactions and as such the Gartski report should be made available forthwith.

 As you have provided no written response to my two recent letters to you detailing the many problems with this NG911, RFP, the procurement process, the incomplete and unapproved stipulated settlement between Consolidated Communications and the Department of Public Service and unresolved network reliability issues, I am extremely concerned that your administration intends to attempt to force this contract though the purchasing process at great risk to public safety as well as further erode the ""faith and trust in government"" that Governor Scott pledged to retore.

Thank you.

Melissa, you may or may not know the answer to my question.
  
I am requesting emails from anthony.cambridge@vermont.gov.  He is a Hinesburg municipal employee with an email address through the Department of Public Safety.  I sent the request to Kristy Pirie, Department of Digital Services. 
 
She advised me that I would have to contact Heidi Storm of the Department of Public Safety.  I was told by Heidi that she could only access DPS employees.  I have attached of the request for your information.
 
Any ideas would be appreciated.
 
Thank you,

I was one of the public in attendance at today’s GMCB meeting. 

Your presentation got me thinking, what criteria does the GMCB use to evaluate hospital economics and budgets? 
If there’s a list or example you can share, please send or provide a pointer. 

Secondly, Can I get a copy of your presentation to the board? It covered many areas and was enticing.

Per our discussion, I am requesting a copy of the file and all materials related to a Sprinkler permit for installation of a sprinkler system at the Stowe Free Library in 1993. Carter's Sprinkler Service was the installer and Bridgewater Construction was the General Contractor for the project. The Town of Stowe is the property owner.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

2.  I missed a good opportunity to speak with you at the (very productive and well organized)  1 November Municipal Day workshops in Rutland.  I’ve learned that several metro Pawlet residents (and the town) corrected their malfunctioning septic systems……but Ms. Gilbert elected not to and there is some  understandable public annoyance about her position…..and the continuing pollution of Flower Brook.
 
After I’ve reviewed the inspection reports and documents, I’ll be back in touch .

As the LSCCF works on the path that will move us forward we’d like to request a few things from your department.
1). The complete records of all Biobase scans that were done on Little Lake - last year and any previous years of sonar scanning. We are looking for all reports and maps that can be accessed from the scan data.  Specifically we want to see the track of the boat, contour with 1 foot intervals, bottom composition, vegetation biovolume heat map, vegetation analysis report, any manual offsets or data adjustments, and whether the scan was completed in one trip or multiple trips were merged.  If multiple trips were merged, we would like to see the same information for the individual trips.  We would also like to know what the established baseline water elevation was at the time of the scan.  At this time we are not requesting the detailed data for vegetative biovolume or bottom composition, but we may want to have a look at it later.  If you want to export that data into excel and send it along, that would be fine.
2) All historical depth measurements taken on Little Lake, and the methods use to take these measurements.
3) Copies of all permits ever issued to the LSCCF
Thank you for your help with this. I’m looking forward to working together for a healthier lake.
Sincerelly,
David

Hello,
 
My name is Jenna Rahrle and I am a graduate student majoring in Public Policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, NY. I am currently in the process of collecting data for my Master thesis paper which focuses on state mental health policy. In order to pursue this research topic, I am requesting data on annual governmental expenditures on mental health programs in your state over the period from FY 2008 through FY 2018 (preferably in spreadsheets) including the following:
 
•      Name of agency that is dedicated to managing state mental health programs; 
•      Total state expenditures on mental health programs;
•      Total state level aid to localities for mental health programs,
•      Total state operation expenditures for mental health programs;
•      Total state capital projects expenditures for mental health programs
•      Detailed breakdown of all expenditure items (if such data are available)
•      Codebook for any and all acronyms/terms included. 
 
Thank you very much for considering my data request. Please do not hesitate to let me know if you have any questions related to my request. I can be reached by email at jmr9673@rit.edu or by phone at (315) 415-8156. Thank you very much in advance, and I look forward to hearing from you.
