        in the meantime:
        xsv search -s 'BOND AMOUNT' '\b\d{1,4}\b' TMPWORK/inmates.csv > main.csv
    - look for data dictionaries

        low bonds individuals are relatively few, and also have shorter times in jail

        xsv search -s 'BOND AMOUNT' '\b\d{1,4}\b' TMPWORK/inmates.csv | xsv select 2 | sort | uniq -c | wc -l
        13199

        xsv search -s 'BOND AMOUNT' '\b\d{1,4}\b' TMPWORK/inmates.csv | wc -l
        386278

    Field Descriptions:

    DOWNLOAD DATE: Date in which the data were extracted and reflecting the population for that day.

    IDENITIFIER: Individual Inmate Identifier

    LATEST ADMISSION DATE: Most recent date in which the inmate has been admitted. In some instances, this may reflect an original date of admission to a correctional facility. Generally, if a date is more than one year old, an inmate should not be considered to have been held for the entire duration of that time.

    RACE: Race of inmate

    AGE: Age of inmate

    BOND AMOUNT: Amount of bond for which the inmate is being held. In some instances, for particularly low (less than $100), this bond amount may be considered a place holder value

    OFFENSE: Controlling offense for which the bond amount has been set.

    FACILITY: Department of Correction facility where the inmate is currently held.

    DETAINER: Denotes whether inmate is being held at the request of another criminal justice agency, or if another agency is to be notified upon release.
