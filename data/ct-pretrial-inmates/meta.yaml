    DOWNLOAD DATE: Date in which the data were extracted and reflecting the population for that day.

    IDENITIFIER: Individual Inmate Identifier

    LATEST ADMISSION DATE: Most recent date in which the inmate has been admitted. In some instances, this may reflect an original date of admission to a correctional facility.

    FACILITY: Department of Correction facility where the inmate is currently held.

    DETAINER: Denotes whether inmate is being held at the request of another criminal justice agency, or if another agency is to be notified upon release.
